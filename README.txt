FuelWings
_________

(IMPORTANT: IF YOU'VE INSTALLED VERSIONS PRIOR TO V1.4, REPLACE YOUR "Wings" FOLDER INSIDE (KSP_Folder)\GameData\Squad\SPP , WITH THE ORIGINAL STOCK "WINGS" FOLDER! IT IS PROVIDED IN "if_needed_(readme).zip")
Fuel resources added to stock, B9 wings, and B9 procedural by Tortoise  (IRC name: Tortoise767, Youtube:Tortoise010, Other: BeautiCode). Credits to azza276 for B9 support, Credits to Critter79606 for compatibility fixes)
This 'addon' allows the SP+ (now integrated with stock since 0.25) wings to contain fuel.
The intention of this is to allow better weight & balance, reduce craft length, and provide more aesthetic pleasure.
See the "FW_FuelValues" file for the fuel max values of the wings.
All wing fuel values are set to 0 by default, you must right-click the wings and add fuel if you'd like.
Supports all stock fuels

INSTALLATION:
(1)Drop all folders inside of GameData folder into (KSP_Folder)\GameData\
(2)Drop ModuleManager.2.5.1.dll into (KSP_Folder)\GameData\
(3)Startup KSP and enjoy!

Startup your game and enjoy!
